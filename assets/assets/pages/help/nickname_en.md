# Nickname

You may want to give a device a nickname to find it more easily in the list of devices.

To do this  **hold** the device you want to select to enter **selection mode**.
After entering selection mode click the <icon>svg-nickname-icon</icon> **button** in the toolbar to
get a dialog for changing the nickname.

Leave the nickname **blank** if you want to remove the nickname.
