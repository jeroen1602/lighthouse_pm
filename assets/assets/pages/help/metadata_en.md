# Metadata

Every device has some metadata and extra actions that you may want to access.
Like changing the state to standby without changing the global setting.

There are two ways to access this feature The first is to **tap** on the lighthouse item.
The second option is to **hold** the <icon>mat-power_settings_new</icon> **button** of the device
you want access the metadata page for.
