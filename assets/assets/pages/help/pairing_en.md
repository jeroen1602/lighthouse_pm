# Pairing a device

You will need to pair a lighthouse before you can communicate with it.
To do this,go to the main page and **click** on the <icon>mat-bluetooth_connected</icon> **Pair button**.
After this select the device you want to connect with from the list.

Version 2.0 lighthouses' name should start with **LHB-**.  
Vive base stations should start with **HTC BS**.
